# Basic Chess
Welcome to Jonathan Trans's Basic Chess Game. \
We are excited to see you here! ðŸ˜Š 

Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard (a checkered game board) with 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid where each player will begin with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six types has its own unique moves.
